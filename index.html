				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>Abstraction is all about art that could
				   easily be done by a three year old. See
				   this layout? It was actually done by a
				   three year old.  That display on the
				   featured page? Yeah. There really isn't
				   anything about this page that anyone 
				   couldn't do better if given a few
				   minutes.  Why am I rambling on and on
				   instead of just adding filler text here?
				   Whenever I see Lorum Ipsum I think someone
				   over the web is casting a spell on me.</p>
			     </div>
			     <div class="span4">
				<h3>Can I be featured?</h3>
				<p>So you want your work to be shown
				   alongside the other outstanding masterpeices
				   arrayed on the featured page? Well if you
				   think you can go toe to toe with other
				   other works such as "Stick Figure rides a
				   Purple Dinosaur" or "Assorted Colors 
				   probably doing some action" submit your
				   pictures now!  It's as easy as submitting
				   your file through the form below!</p>

			     <div class="span4">
				<h3>Inspiration</h3>
			        <p>At first I was afraid.  I was petrified.
				   Kept thinking I could never live without
				   you by my side. But I spent so many nights
				   thinking how you did me wrong and I grew
				   strong. I learned how to get along.  And
				   now you're back from outer space.  I just
				   walked in to find you here with that sad 
				   look upon your face...As long as I know how
				   to love I know I'll stay alive.</p>
